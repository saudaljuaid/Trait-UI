 * pcmanfm, which is LXDE's file manager.
 *
 * Its LXDE profile (lxde-common, /etc/xdg/pcmanfm/LXDE/pcmanfm.conf)
 * gives the defaults this follows:
 *
 *     win_width=640  win_height=480
 *     view_mode=icon
 *     show_hidden=0
 *     sort=name;ascending;
 *
 * and its window is a menu bar, a toolbar of Back/Forward/Up/Home with a
 * location bar after them, a side pane of Places, the view, and a
 * two-field status bar.
 *
 * THERE IS A FILESYSTEM UNDER IT.  Navigating really moves, the status
 * bar counts what is actually there, and a folder's size is the sum of
 * what is in it - not a number chosen to look plausible.  A file manager
 * drawn over a fixed list of names is a picture of a file manager.
