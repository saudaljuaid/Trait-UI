"""Turn application artwork into the colour and alpha planes the taskbar takes.

Unlike the Lucide marks, these are pictures: gradients, shading, a camera
lens, a document with text on it. They cannot be stated as geometry, so they
are carried as bitmaps — one pair of planes per size the bar draws at, each
resampled from the original rather than from a larger cell, because a picture
reduced twice is a picture blurred twice.

    python3 tools/make-app-icons.py assets/c-panel src/trait_panel_art.h

The same artwork is wanted at other sizes by other windows - File Explorer
draws folders at 16, 20, 24, 32 and 48 where the bar draws apps at 16, 24, 32
and 48 - so the table it emits is named and sized by argument rather than
fixed:

    python3 tools/make-app-icons.py assets/icons/app \\
        src/kernel/explorer_art.h --prefix explorer_art \\
        --sizes 16,20,24,32,48 --only folder-yellow,folder-orange,drive

Two things happen on the way in. Artwork delivered as a JPEG has no alpha and
therefore a background; the flat colour it sits on is keyed out from the
border inwards, so an enclosed white shape inside the icon survives while the
white around it does not. And every icon is cropped to its own ink and padded
back to a square, so a mark that was drawn small inside a large canvas fills
its button rather than floating in the middle of it.

# The Store's bag needed it while the mark on it was the same achromatic
# near-white as the bag: ink averaging 227 of 255 with a chroma under 2, a
# shape you had to already know was there on the light taskbar. The bag it
# carries now has Phipia's logo on it in the accent blue, which separates
